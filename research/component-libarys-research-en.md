### What is a component library&#x20;

A component library comprises pre-designed and pre-built user interface elements that can be utilized across various projects. This tool is invaluable as it enables the utilization of thoroughly tested, reviewed, and refined components, ensuring efficient development.&#x20;

Component libraries are great tools to work with and have a lot of features. However, one significant drawback is that some of them have steep learning curve. This learning curve can draw users into the library's ecosystem to such an extent that they become overly reliant on it, hindering their ability to enhance their styling or behavioral functionality of their site.&#x20;

For our us, an ideal component library should fulfill several criteria. Firstly, it should provide a consistent and universal style across the entire website, achieved through the implementation of a theme. Secondly, it should offer customizable styles by using css extensions frameworks such a Tailwind. Or a style system such as bootstrap Despite the fact that style systems offer a lot of limitations witch also limit your creativity we cant overlook the fact that they are great tools for people with less css knowledge and that cant be bothered to write css or tailwind like back end developers they also are perfect for small projects that need to be done fast. Thats why il include them in this research. Lastly it should also have a solid well worked out behavior, that keeps track of stuff like keyboard navigation, basically it needs to be user friendly.&#x20;

In summary, when choosing a component library, consider factors like consistency, customization options, and user-friendly behavior.&#x20;

&#x20;

#### Tailwind UI (Creator: Adam Wathan) - Components: 400+&#x20;

Tailwind UI is a great component libary however it has its drawbacks.&#x20;

Firstly, it's comes with a payment.&#x20;

Additionally, since it primarily provides CSS components, users must supplement it with their own behavioral components or use a behavior library such as Radix.&#x20;

&#x20;

Radix UI (Creator: Abdul hadihallak) - Components: 20+&#x20;

Radix ui is a component libary that comes style free. It doesn't have a lot of components but its components have great behavior functionality.&#x20;

Shadcn (Creator: Shadcn) - Components: 40+&#x20;

Shadcn is one of my favorites, its based on radix. It it has a big libary of components, but its not a component libraries. Its a online libary where u can copy components from and use them in ur project as ur own components, it harnesses the power of Tailwind CSS.&#x20;

&#x20;

#### React aria( Creator: adobe) - Components 40+ &#x20;

React Aria provides a lot of tools, including hooks, testing, and routing. However, I will focus on its components. It offers a diverse selection of well-crafted components with practical applications. Additionally, it is style-agnostic, allowing you to easily integrate Tailwind CSS or something else.&#x20;

#### Next UI (Creator: Next.js) - Components: 30+ &#x20;

The next UI has a smooth design and its built on top of Tailwind CSS and React Aria, providing a strong foundation. However, the drawback I've noticed is its limited range of components, which tend to be quite basic what i mean by that is it has everything u need for a basic website but that's it, its has nothing that rlly makes it stand out.&#x20;

#### Material-UI (Creator: Google) - Components: 60+&#x20;

Material UI can be seen as a neutral library, performing oke in all aspects without standing out. However, it distinguishes itself with its extensive collection of components and its lack of predefined styles, offering users ample flexibility in CSS customization.&#x20;

#### Ant Design (Creator: Ant Group) - Components: 50+&#x20;

Ant design has deftly some unique components ideal for data entry it i would defnetly use this if im ever working on a site that's heavenly reliant on data entry &#x20;

#### Chakra UI (Creator: Segun Adebayo) - Components: 50+&#x20;

Chakra has a high learning curve which is not something a component libary should have What i mean with high learning curve is that with chakra u will need to understand their styling, hooks, and components, as well as how they integrate with one another. To be able to start using chakra .&#x20;

&#x20;

#### Headless UI (Creator: Tailwind Labs) - Components: 10+&#x20;

Headless ui is great is has a lot of promise to it but its just to young to be a competitor towards the others. But im sure it will be a great tool in the future.&#x20;

React Bootstrap (Creator: React-Bootstrap) - Components: 30+&#x20;

React Bootstrap is a great tool for devs who don't want to write css but it comes with a lot of limitations if u wane customize your app to the next level.&#x20;

#### Fluent UI (Creator: Microsoft) - Components: 100+&#x20;

Fluent UI is great if u want a Microsoft like vibe to your applications. Notably, it stands out as the sole option in this lineup that ensures cross-platform compatibility. Whether you're crafting iOS apps or venturing into web development, Fluent UI maintains consistency in appearance across platforms.&#x20;

#### Carbon Design System (Creator: IBM) - Components: 100+&#x20;

The carbon Design system also has also a part that rlly stands out it has a great collection of data visualization components. From charts to maps to tables, it encompasses everything necessary for data visualization.&#x20;

&#x20;

Each of these component libraries has its strengths and weaknesses, with the suitability depending on specific project requirements. In the case of Antistatic, a 3D printing company, we prioritize not only popularity but also features such as theme support, modern aesthetics, and dashboard functionality.

### Conclusion:

If we decide to use a React component library, i would recommend the following options:

1. Material-UI
2. Fluent UI
3. Carbon Design System
4. React-Aria
5. Radix UI

Alternatively, if we deside not to use a component library, we  could utilizing Tailwind in together with Shadcn. Shadcn provides an extensive library of components that can be copied and reused , based on the Radix UI component library. This alternative eliminates dependency on a component library while offering greater flexibility for customization.

In the future, attention should also be given to Next UI, Headless UI, Shadcn, and Radix UI, as these libraries show promise and potential for further development.
