### What is a component library?

A component library comprises pre-designed and pre-built user interface elements that can be utilized across various projects. This tool is invaluable as it enables the utilization of thoroughly tested, reviewed, and refined components, ensuring efficient development.

Component libraries are great tools to work with and have a lot of features. However, one significant drawback is that some can draw users into the library's ecosystem to such an extent that they become overly reliant on it, hindering their ability to enhance the styling or behavioral functionality of their site.

An ideal component library should fulfill several criteria. Firstly, it should provide a consistent and universal style across the entire website, achieved through the implementation of a theme. Secondly, it should offer customizable styles by using CSS or an extension framework such as Tailwind. Or a style system such as Bootstrap Despite the fact that style systems offer a lot of limitations that also limit your creativity, we can't overlook the fact that they are great tools for people with less CSS knowledge who can't be bothered to write CSS or tailwind like back end developers. They are also perfect for small projects that need to be done quickly. That's why I included them in this research. Lastly, it should also have solid, well-thought-out behavior that keeps track of stuff like keyboard navigation; basically, it needs to be user friendly.

In summary, when choosing a component library, consider factors like consistency, customization options, and user-friendly behavior.\

**Tailwind UI (Creator: Adam Wathan): Components: 400+**

Tailwind UI is a great component library; however, it has its drawbacks. Firstly, some things require a one time payment. Additionally, since it primarily provides CSS components, users need to add their own behavioral components or use a behavior library such as Radix to get a good user experience.

**Radix UI (Creator: Abdul Hadihallak): Components: 20+**

Radix UI is a component library that has a style free and styled version. The styled version is styled with Tailwind. It doesn't have a lot of components, but its components have great behavioral functionality.

**Shadcn (Creator: Shadcn): Components: 40+**

Shadcn is one of my favorites; it's based on Radix. It has a big library of components, but it's not a component library. It's an online library where you can copy components from and use them in your project as your own components. It harnesses the power of Tailwind CSS. Even though shadcn is a copy paste library, it does come with some dependencies, like tailwind animation, etc.

**Aceternity UI (Creator: Aceternity): Components: 40+**

Aceternity UI is akin to Shadcn, a copy-paste library, but what sets it apart is that Aceternity UI doesn't concentrate on creating components solely for building websites. Instead, it emphasizes crafting focal point components that attract attention. Unfortunately, some of the components in the Aceternity UI have dependencies. Aceternity UI also offers the option to request custom components for a certain monthly price.

**React Aria (Creator: Adobe): Components: 40+**

React Aria provides a lot of tools, including hooks, testing, and routing. However, I will focus on its components. It offers a diverse selection of well-crafted components with practical applications. Additionally, it is style-agnostic, allowing you to easily integrate Tailwind CSS or something else.

**Next UI (Creator: Next.js): Components: 30+**

Next UI has a smooth design, and it's built on top of Tailwind CSS and React Aria, providing a strong foundation. However, the drawback I've noticed is its limited range of components, which tend to be quite basic. What I mean by that is that it has everything you need for a basic website, but that's it. It doesn't have any crazy components.

**Material-UI (Creator: Google): Components: 60+**

Material UI can be seen as a neutral library, performing okay in all aspects without standing out. However, it distinguishes itself with its extensive collection of components and its lack of predefined styles, offering users ample flexibility in CSS customization.

**Ant Design (Creator: Ant Group): Components: 50+**

Ant Design has some unique components ideal for data entry. I would definitely use this if I'm ever working on a dashboard site that's heavily reliant on data entry and input .

**Chakra UI (Creator: Segun Adebayo): Components: 50+**

Chakra has a comprehensive library, but the downside is that its ecosystem can make you somewhat dependent on it. While it's a powerful tool, it may require some time to fully grasp the Chakra UI due to its complexity.

**React Bootstrap (Creator: React-Bootstrap): Components: 30+**

React Bootstrap is a great tool for developers who would like to optimize their development time. It's fast and easy to write. but it comes with some limitations if you want to customize your website's style.

**Headless UI (Creator: Tailwind Labs) Components: 10+**

Headless UI shares similarities with React Bootstrap and aims to provide developers with styling freedom, likely because it was made by Tailwind. However, it's just too young to be a competitor to the others. But I'm sure it will be a great tool in the future.

**Fluent UI (Creator: Microsoft): Components: 100+**

Fluent UI is great if you want a Microsoft-like vibe to your applications; it stands out as the sole option in this lineup that ensures cross-platform compatibility. Whether you're making iOS apps or web development, Fluent UI maintains consistency in appearance across platforms.

**Carbon Design System (Creator: IBM): Components: 100+**

The Carbon Design System also has a part that really stands out; it has a great collection of data visualization components. From charts to maps to tables, it has everything necessary for data visualization.\

1. Tailwind UI has many different templates and components for community applications.
2. Next UI has some eye caching components that would fit greatly in a community application.
3. React Bootstrap
4. Fluent UI has proven that it can be used for great community applications. just look at teams and outlook

* **Cross device applications**\
  Unfortunately, I only found one application that really fits this description.

1. Fluent UI is compatible with Web, Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android.

* **Copy-paste libraries where you don't need to install a component library into your project.**

1. Aceternity UI can be used using the cli or by directly copying the component .
2. Shadcn can be used using the cli or by directly copying the component.

* **NO CSS  Component libraries that use their own system to style your website.**

1. Tailwind UI is a great tool to reduce the amount of time you spend on style while still being able to alter every part of the style.
2. React Bootstrap is great for creating styles at record speeds, but unfortunately, it doesn't have much in the field of customization. Still, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good looking style for a small project where there isn't much customization needed.
3. Chakra UI uses something quite different; it uses parameters to style its components. It does its job well, but it can be hard to start with.\
