# Authentication providers

&#x20;

Auth0&#x20;

Auth0 is very user-friendly and perfect for quickly starting small and big projects that can be scaled up. You get 7,500 monthly active users free in the free plan, with the possibility to upgrade your plan as your project grows, and you can even get a custom price after your application is at a enterprise level.&#x20;

&#x20;&#x20;

SuperTokens&#x20;

SuperTokens is a free, open-source solution that gives you full control over your backend. It's easy to start with and highly customizable, allowing self-hosting for complete control. Alternatively, you can let SuperTokens handle the hosting for a fee of $0.02 per monthly active user. For comparison, 7,000 monthly users would cost $140 per month with SuperTokens' hosting. Self-hosting can reduce costs to only the hosting fees.&#x20;

&#x20;

FusionAuth&#x20;

FusionAuth, like SuperTokens, can be self-hosted or you can use their hosting plan. Unlike SuperTokens or Auth0, FusionAuth's hosting comes with no limit on monthly users in the free plan, though it restricts some of the functionality you can use. However, once you upgrade from free trial, you will need to pay for your monthly users.&#x20;

&#x20;

AWS Cognito&#x20;

AWS Cognito is easy to set up and integrates well with other AWS services. It requires an AWS developer account and is not free, but you only pay for active monthly users, potentially saving money. Additionally, you get 12 months free for up to 50,000 active users.&#x20;

&#x20;

OAuth 2.0 with Google APIs:&#x20;

Google's OAuth 2.0 offering stands out as one of the most generous options available. In its free tier, you receive 49,999 monthly free uses, catering to a significant user base without initial cost. Beyond this threshold, there's a charge per active monthly user, but Google offers discounts as your user count grows. However, the pricing structure extends beyond user counts, as additional features like SMS verification have separate charges. Notably, the price per SMS varies based on the recipient's country, adding a layer of flexibility to the payment structure.&#x20;

&#x20;

Firebase Authentication:&#x20;

Firebase Authentication offers a diverse range of authentication methods bundled with standard payment options within your Firebase plan. It also provides a free tier, making it a suitable choice if you're already integrated into the Firebase ecosystem. However, it's not advisable to utilize Firebase Authentication if your application doesn't rely on Firebase services.&#x20;
